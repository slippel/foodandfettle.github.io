									<p class="new_paragraph2">Steffi Lippel, doing business as Food & Fettle, provides a caring and attentive presence, as well as personalized attention to detail. A focus on healing, integration of diet and lifestyle, and encouragement of positive body image are an important part of my approach. 
									I hold a Masters of Science in Nutrition, and take a holistic, science-based approach to food recommendations and therapeutic diets. Additionally, I am open to a variety of eating and diet ideologies. 
									A priority is sourcing fresh ingredients, with an appreciation for local and seasonally sourced foods and products, while making every effort to make healthy eating affordable and accessible. I am always seeking new food ideas, in order to keep your eating experience fresh and exciting. 
									I offer nutritional counseling, personal chef service, as well as healthy cooking lessons, pantry sweeps, and guided shopping trips aimed at helping you become comfortable navigating the grocery shopping experience.</b></p>
									<p class="new_paragraph">A little more about my philosophy...</b></p>
									<p class="new_paragraph2">Humans have become disconnected from their food. From the time the seeds spend in the soil, through the hands that harvest, to the acts of shopping, cooking, and eating, as well as the effects diet and nutrition have on your health and well-being, food is a topic that few are completely comfortable with. 
									In my work, I take the entire modern human food chain into consideration. I prefer to emphasize ingredients that have been responsibly grown and produced, while making meal planning, shopping, and cooking easy. My goal is to help you understand how you can feel better in your body and mind through your food choices.</b></p>

									<h class="new_header3">Candice S. - 9/27/17</h>
										<blockquote><p class="new_paragraph3">I contacted Steffi with fatigue and digestive issues that have been plaguing me for years. She responded immediately with an array of situational questions to diagnose accurately. Just that step alone started the realization process of my sugar induced crash and burn diet. She developed a personal plan to cut my sugar, increase water consumption, and healthy ways to get thru my swing shift work schedule. She also introduced bitters for digestion including recipes to make my own. (I have made and still use daily.) This literately changed my life. I'm lactose and gluten intolerant and have trouble digesting most food combinations. With the aid of bitters, I actually feel my stomach working again. I'm now not afraid to eat hearty meals, which was the cyclic problem of amping up on carbs for energy. Steffi checked in often and made me feel truly important with one on one guidance.</p></blockquote>
									
									<h class="new_header3">Brigitte H. - 9/15/17</h>
										<blockquote><p class="new_paragraph3">My mother is 93 years of age, living alone and relatively healthy. However, she has not really enjoyed food for a long time and didn't have much of an appetite, which left her tired and listless. She hates the Boost and Ensure beverages-she says they are much too sweet. Steffi was able to formulate a smoothie plan that is both tasty and packed with the appropriate nutrients. My mother now almost seems to gleefully look for kale, spinach and berries in the supermarket. And she has her energy back - most days she walks a mile!</p></blockquote>
									
									<h class="new_header3">Garnet Emma B. - 9/14/17</h>
										<blockquote><p class="new_paragraph3">Steffi helped me through one of the worst times that I have ever had in my body. The recomendations that she made have changed my life for the better. I'm truly grateful for her knowledge, and the way she applies it. I would highly recommend her to anyone.</p></blockquote>
